# How you can contribute!

It's a tough job writing documentation which covers every use case and scenario
- mainly because Juju is so versatile it can be used in so many ways. That is
why we hope to get plenty of feedback from users to help extend, amend and
improve the documentation. It is really easy and you don't have to be the
world's best writer. Our grammar goblins will sort out any problems with the
words, but your knowledge is very useful to us.

# How to write docs!

Contributing to the docs is really easy because it is all written in GitHub
flavored [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown).
You will find most of the source documents are very straightforward and
human-readable, if you just want to dip in and change a paragraph or add some
extra info. The Juju docs use a modified version of the [Github Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to compose the content of the docs. We've retained the majority of GFM, with the exception of "Username linking" and "Emoji", both of which are Github specific.

In addition to the removals, we've also created several new Markdown definitions to implement features required for the docs. These definitions are outlined below.

## Grab the docs and get to work

The code is available on [github.com/juju/docs](http://github.com/juju/docs).
Clone it, edit it, and then
[submit](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) a pull
request.

We enforce 80 columns for every text file to keep it readable. Here are
instructions for two editors:

- [vim](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3033423/vim-command-to-restructure-force-text-to-80-columns)
- [emacs](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EightyColumnRule)

Here is a handy [Markdown reference](http://askubuntu.com/editing-help)) to get
you started, and don't forget to reference the
[GitHub Flavored
Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) reference.

The individual document pages are in the `src` directory. From there each
language is seperated into it's own directory by language code. So for example
English is in `src/en`.

## Sections

All the text is organised into sections. These are autogenerated, there is
nothing extra you need to do:

    # <h1> equivalent
    ## <h2> equivalent
    ### <h3> equivalent

## Code Blocks

To code block something indent each line with 4 whitespace characters.

## Inline code

Use a backtick to `inline commands and other literals`.

## Notes, Warnings, Callouts, Admonishments

Callouts are used to notify the user of additional information or warn them of potential pitfalls. This will create a notification resembling the following in the docs:

![callout](media/note.png)

To implement this callout, use the following syntax:

```
!!! Note: If you want to get more information on what is actually happening, or to help resolve problems, you can add the `--show-log` switch to the juju command to get verbose output.
```

## Foldouts

When a page contains a high volume of information that would otherwise require a table of contents, or similar method of quick navigation, a foldout can be used. This will create a collapsed header which, when clicked, will expand to display all the content below it.

```
^# Header
  Content can be multi-paragraphed and will be sent through the Markdown parser

  As long as content is continually indented under the header
```

# Adding pages

If you find you need to add a page to the documentation, then you will also
need to add it to the navigation, which means altering one file,
`src/navigation.tpl`.

Add the page with the following format:

    <li class="sub"><a href="charms-scaling.html">Scaling Services</a></li>;

in the appropriate section. Please make sure you submit a merge proposal
with a description of the new page and why it is needed!

## Adding Screenshots

When adding screenshots place them in `htmldocs/media`. To reference them in your page use the syntax `![description](media/picture.png)`

# Testing or Deploying locally

First you need to generate the docs from the Markdown. In the root directory
first get the dependencies and make the docs:

    make sysdeps
    make

**Note:** You only need to `make sysdeps` once, after that you'll have all the
dependencies you'll need to build the docs going forward.

The documentation makes use of Javascript for some functionality, so in order
to test the docs properly or serve them locally, you will need to have an http
server set up.

On Ubuntu this is easy. Install (if you need to) and start the apache2 web
server, then just copy the htmldocs directory to a convenient location -

    sudo cp -R htmldocs /var/www/htmldocs

You can then point your web browser at your local machine (127.0.0.1/htmldocs)
to view the files.

Alternatively, you can use Python to start a simple HTTP server on the docs
directory. Navigate to the `/htmldocs` directory of the docs and run the
following:

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

## Submitting your work

We love it when the community contributes to documentation, here's how to
contribute:

- The code is available on [github.com/juju/docs](http://github.com/juju/docs)
- [Fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
- Add or edit the documentation in your favorite text editor
- [Submit a pull requestion](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request)

And that's it! Someone from the Juju team will review your work and merge it
in! Please don't forget to review the page before submission.
