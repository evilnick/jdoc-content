# Troubleshooting the Local Provider

The local provider uses LXC containers under the hood to provide nodes for you
to deploy on. Sometimes things go wrong and you need to debug what is happening
on your machine. This page is a collection of best practices from the communtiy
on diagnosing and solving Juju local provider issues.

## Bootstrap fails

Every time bootstrap fails, you'll need to run `juju destroy-environment -e
local` prior to continuing. First let's rerun a bootstrap in debug mode:

    juju boostrap --show-log --debug

This will print very verbose output. If you're receiving `connection failed,
will retry: dial tcp 127.0.0.1:37017: connection refused` error at the end of
the run, proceed with the troubleshooting guide. If not the error presented will inform you what went wrong.

In certain cases you might get this something similar to thiserror: `Get
http://10.0.3.1:8040/provider-state: dial tcp 10.0.3.1:8040: connection
refused`.

This can be solved by removing miscellaneous .jenv files in
`~/.juju/environments` and rerunning the bootstrap command.

## Connection failed, will retry

This occurs when the juju API server and Database server fail to start within
the alloted timeout. This can occur for one of several reasons. After the
bootstrap command fails run the following command:

    sudo initctl list | grep juju

You should see two jobs listed. One that starts with `juju-db` the other `juju-
agent`. If these are both in a start/running state then your machine took longer than juju expected to get these services started. If you're on an encrypted partition see TODO: INSTRUCTIONS ON THIS. If you're not TODO: INSTRUCTIONS ON RAM DISK DOES NOT EXIST.

If either of these have stopped, investigate the logs at `/var/log/upstart/juju-db*.log` or `/var/log/upstart/juju-agent*.log` If the juju-db service failed to start with messages of unsupported command-line options, check the version of mongodb installed:

    dpkg -l | grep mongodb-server

If you have a version less than 1:2.2.4-0ubuntu1 make sure you have either the
[Cloud Tools Archive](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerTeam/CloudToolsArchive) or
ppa:juju/stable added to your system. `sudo apt-get update` then install juju-
local package. Before retrying, make sure you run `juju destroy-environment`

## No machines start

If you get a successful bootstrap, but services you deploy never come up,
there's a chance that you have an older version of the Ubuntu Cloud Image cached on your machine. To verify this, check the timestamp of the contents in
`/var/cache/lxc/cloud-precise/`

    ls -lh /var/cache/lxc/cloud-precise/

If the contents of this directory are older than a few weeks, delete files
present, destroy the environment with `juju destroy-environment`, rebootstrap
and attempt deployment again.
